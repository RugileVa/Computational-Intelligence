1. `artificial_neuron.py.`  
The goal is to model the principles of artificial neuron operation.\
We need to find such weight values `w0, w1, w2` so that after calculating `a` = w0x0 + w1x1 + w2x2 and the activation function (threshold and sigmoid) `f(a)`, the output `y` would solve the classification task, matching the obtained values with the values of the data classes.
2. `training_artificial_neuron.py`
Training a single neuron to solve a two-class problem using batch gradient descent and a sigmoid neuron. Iris and breast cancer datasets were analyzed.
